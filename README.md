# Projects
First Project on Python

So, i had this need to change files in bulk and add some kind of indicator to them, so i developed this tool to help me with that, yes, i know there are many tools online that can do that, but i wanted to experiment and develop some skills.
Feel free to use it for yourself, although i don't know if it will work the way you intend it to, so test it before doing something more drastic.

The random age generator does exacly what it says, generates a random age ranged from 18-23yo, 24-29yo, etc. It was for a project but its not going through.

Thanks for coming!
